	<h2>Our Cause:</h2>
	<p>Providing less priveleged kids with the opportunity to learn how to play hockey. All children, regardless of disability or socioeconomic status should be able to participate in this great sport. I want to make sure every kid who wants play is provided with equipment, coaching, and a place to do so.</p>
